A mod allowing you to pilot zoe in first person!

You can enable and disable it in settings as well as adjust fov and camera height.

The mod piggy backs off of the in game first person toggle on playerdata.

My future plans are to add a ui element at the bottom to show boost level and attempt to add back in foot steps

There is an issue where if the mod activates when the entering from the main menu animation plays or on the shard exit animation it bugs out and disables player movement. I worked around this by just delaying the activation by 4 seconds when on the hub scene, but if this is a problem with more animations lmk! you can msg me on discord: ricowilliams
